# Redis Cluster

This project is my first try to create a redis cluster using [amphp/amp](https://github.com/amphp/amp) and [amphp/redis](https://github.com/amphp/amp). The goal is to build an easy-to-use library that will have good compatibility with `amphp/redis`.

Current working branch is `0.0.2`.

Now, I am just starting working on this project, so if you have any ideas that can help me to make this project better, please, text me by email [`dmitrii@dways.org`](mailto:dmitrii@dways.org). I will be happy to discuss with you about any solutions.
